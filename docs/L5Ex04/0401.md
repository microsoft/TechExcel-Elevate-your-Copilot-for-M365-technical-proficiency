# Task 4.1: Manage eDiscovery (Standard) or (Premium) in Microsoft Purview

Electronic discovery, or eDiscovery, is the process of identifying and delivering electronic information that can be used as evidence in legal cases.  

You can use eDiscovery tools in Microsoft Purview to search for content in Exchange Online, OneDrive for Business, SharePoint Online, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft 365 Groups, and Viva Engage teams. 

You can search mailboxes and sites in the same eDiscovery search, and then export the search results. You can use Microsoft Purview eDiscovery (Standard) cases to identify, hold, and export content found in mailboxes and sites.  
 
If your organization has an Office 365 E5 or Microsoft 365 E5 subscription (or related E5 add-on subscriptions), you can further manage custodians and analyze content by using the feature-rich Microsoft Purview eDiscovery (Premium) solution in Microsoft 365.
