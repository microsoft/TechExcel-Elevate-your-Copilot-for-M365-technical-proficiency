# Lab 2: Configure Users in Microsoft 365 admin center

Copilot for Microsoft 365 has been deployed for Contoso. Now they need to configure users’ access to Copilot and find a way to review adoption, retention, and engagement metrics.   
 
As the Contoso Global Administrator for M365, you’ll configure roles in Microsoft 365 admin center for Copilot in the Contoso organization.  

You’ll assign Copilot licenses using the Microsoft 365 admin center and automatically send welcome messages to your users to introduce them to Copilot and its features.    

You’ll enable feedback for the Microsoft 365 apps so that Copilot users can provide feedback with their thumbs up or thumbs down reaction to what Copilot produced from their prompt.   

Finally, you’ll review a Copilot for Microsoft 365 usage report in the Microsoft 365 admin center to get a summary of user adoption, retention, and engagement with Copilot.  


# Exercise 1: Configuring users and roles
