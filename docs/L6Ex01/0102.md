# Task 1.2: Sharing links reports 

Sharing links reports help you identify potential oversharing by seeing the sites where users have created the latest sharing links. 

1. On the **Data access governance** page, under **Sharing links**, select **View reports**.

1. Notice the available report links:

    | Report name | **Description* |
    |:---------|:---------|
    | **"Anyone" links**   | This report gives you a list of sites in which the highest number of Anyone links were created. These links let anyone access files and folders without signing in.   |
    | **"People in the organization" links**   | This report gives you a list of sites in which the highest number of “People in the organization” links were created. These links can be forwarded internally and let anyone in the organization access files and folders.   |
    | **"Specific people" links shared externally**   | This report gives you a list of sites in which the highest number of “specific people” links were created for people outside the organization.   |

    {: .important }
    > To get the latest data for a report, run the report. You can run all reports or select individual reports to run. It might take a few hours for reports to run. To check if a report is ready or when it was last updated, see the Status column. Each report can be run only once every 24 hours.

    {: .note }
    > When a report is ready, select it to view the data. Each sharing link report includes: 
    >- Up to 100 sites with the highest number of sharing links created in the last 30 days.
    >- The policies applied to these sites – site sensitivity, site unmanaged device policy, and site external sharing policy.
    >- The primary admin for each site. Note that the reports don't include OneDrive data.
