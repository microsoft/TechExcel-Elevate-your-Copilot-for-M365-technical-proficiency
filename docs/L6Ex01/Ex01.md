# Lab 5: SharePoint collaboration
 
As sprawl and oversharing of SharePoint sites increase with exponential data growth, Contoso needs help to govern their data and enhance their Microsoft 365 secure collaboration capabilities.

You’ll use the Data Access Governance (DAG) capability in SharePoint Advanced Management to identify potential oversharing by monitoring sites where users created new sharing links in SharePoint and sites where sensitive files are stored and the policies have been detected. 

You’ll also apply conditional access policies to enforce more stringent access conditions for SharePoint sites, secure document libraries with default labels, and restrict OneDrive access to members of specific security groups. Finally, you’ll ensure that SharePoint Advanced Management licenses are available for all employees who are in scope or who may benefit from Data Access Governance.


# Exercise 1: SharePoint Data Access Governance 

In this exercise, you'll be accessing and analyzing Data Access Governance (DAG) reports, reviewing sharing links reports, monitoring sensitivity labels applied to files, and creating and managing site lifecycle management policies.
