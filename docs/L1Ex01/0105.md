# Task 1.5: Enable auditing

Auditing can take an hour to become active. This is being enabled now so that later labs will be able to leverage the auditing capability of Microsoft Purview. 

Audit logging is turned on by default for Microsoft 365 organizations. However, when setting up a new Microsoft 365 organization, you should verify the auditing status for your organization.

    If the Audit solution card isn't displayed, select **View all solutions** and then select **Audit** from the **Core** section.
