> If you're deploying Microsoft 365 Apps with Intune using the Microsoft 365 Apps for Windows 10 and later app, the channel selected in the app configuration is re-evaluated and enforced during policy refresh. If the channels don't match, this causes unexpected channel flipping under the following circumstances:
>
Deploying Microsoft 365 Apps using the Microsoft 365 Apps for Windows 10 and later app.
- The app is configured using the Configuration designer.
- The app is assigned as required.
- The selected channel differs from the newly assigned one.
>
If this matches your current configuration, adjust your Microsoft 365 Apps for Windows 10 or later apps:
>
- Update the configuration of the existing app to exclude the Microsoft Entra ID security groups you created for the channel change.
- Create new Microsoft 365 Apps for Windows 10 or later apps with the newly assigned update channel.
>
If you're moving devices to both Current and Monthly Enterprise Channel, you have to create two new apps. Assign the newly created apps to the respective Microsoft Entra ID security groups.
